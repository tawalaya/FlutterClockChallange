# Submission of [Flutter Clock Challenge](https://flutter.dev/clock#submissions) by [Sebastian Werner](https://github.com/tawalaya/) and [Andreas Salzmann](https://github.com/andi3/)

For the challenge we build an analog clock that also shows all calender events of the local device calender, so that you can always see what event comes next.
